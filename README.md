Kaggle's toxic comment classification

Repository for my on going competition "toxic comment classification". Notebook.ipynb notebook contains the approaches I have tried
which includes training a basic logistic regression model on tf-idf vetorizer ,a  Naive bias classifier.I used  Frequecy based embedding and word2vec embedding techniques to produce better feature representation (semantic meaning catching ) and further applied deep learning models .
